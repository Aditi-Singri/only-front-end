"it was a good stay in fairfield by marriot, anjuna, goa. However, if i may submit a point for improvement i would say that the double bed needs to be put with a single mattress rather than two mattress for a double bed. Rest the staff was prompt and upto the mark. Excellent cleanliness. Good breakfast as it was included in my booking. Beautiful swimming pool. Good basic facility for gym. Overall a very good experience "
